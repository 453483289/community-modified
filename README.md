This repository contains [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) signature modules from the community, including
those heavily modified by Accuvant for correctness, removal of false positives,
and more detailed information.  It also includes over 60 new signature modules
developed solely by Accuvant and provided under the GPL.

Please note that many of these signature modules make use of Accuvant's extensive
improvements to both Cuckoo and cuckoomon and are noted accordingly as requiring
Cuckoo version "1.2".

If you have signature modules to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests or
email bspengler@accuvant.com.
